    "SelfIntroduction":"I graduated from Tamkang University in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering.\n\nI am passionate about programming, so I tried a lot of different Programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Golang, etc.\n\nHowever, due to university courses, I was exposed to web front-end development. Until now, I still love web front-end development.\n\nNow, I am still improving my skills, such as learning React.js, Next.js, CSS typography, etc.\n\nIn addition, I am also very interested in back-end technology. Like Golang, Node.js, etc.\n\nSo in the future, I will focus on the front-end. If I have spare time, I will also learn more about the back-end technology.",
